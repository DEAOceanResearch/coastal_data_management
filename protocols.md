# Data Management Protocols for Coastal Research
## Preamble
Data on rocky shore environments will be collected by various volunteers and regional bodies. The data in the form of photographs along transects on the shore will be collected, uploaded to a server and made available on a website. 

## Data Collection Procedures

## Data Management Description

Each photo must be tagged with the time and position (date, time, latitude and longitude from GPS), transect number, position on the transect, data collector name, affiliation, equipment used, exposure settings. 

Photos are uploaded to the server.

Each photo is assigned a UUID. 

Each set of photos is assigned a group UUID, and a record created linking individual UUIDs to the group ID. 

Metadata tagged with UUIDs are added to catalogue.
